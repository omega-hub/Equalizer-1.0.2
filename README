 This directory is the top-level directory for the Equalizer sources.
 For Windows, use cmake to build a Visual Studio Solution. For all other
 platforms, executing 'make' invokes cmake and builds all debug
 targets. See also the doc/FAQ.  Platform-specific READMEs are in
 doc/. End-User and developer documentation can be found on the
 Equalizer website at http://www.equalizergraphics.com/

                           Running Equalizer

 The main example is eqPly, a scalable rendering program for polygonal
 data. Furthermore, there is eqHello, a very simple Equalizer program,
 eVolve, a scalable volume renderer and osgScaleViewer, an
 OpenSceneGraph-based example. To run examples, simply start the
 executable: debug/bin/eqPly'.

 The default launch mechanism for nodes uses ssh. If your configuration
 contains remote nodes, make sure a passwordless login using ssh is
 possible, or reconfigure the launch command accordingly.

                           Build Environment

 The build environment is using CMake 2.8 or later. Furthermore, flex
 and bison are needed during compilation. More details can be found in
 README.CMake.
