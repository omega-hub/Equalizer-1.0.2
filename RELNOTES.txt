1. Introduction

   Welcome to Equalizer, the standard middleware to create and
   deploy parallel, scalable OpenGL applications. This release
   is a bugfix release for Equalizer 1.0.

   Equalizer 1.0.1 culminates over 6 years of development and
   decades of experience into a feature-rich, high-performance
   and mature parallel rendering framework and an
   object-oriented high-level network library. It is intended
   for all application developers creating parallel,
   interactive OpenGL applications. Equalizer 1.0.1 can be
   retrieved by downloading the source code, updating the
   subversion trunk to revision 5834 (svn up -r 5834) or by
   using:
   svn co
   https://equalizer.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/equalizer/tags/release-1.0.1

  1.1. Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to
   facilitate the development and deployment of scalable
   OpenGL applications. A detailed feature list can be found
   on the Equalizer website.

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application is
       configured at runtime and can be deployed on laptops,
       multi-GPU workstations and large-scale visualization
       clusters without recompilation.
     * Runtime Scalability: An Equalizer application can
       benefit from multiple graphics cards, processors and
       computers to scale rendering performance, visual
       quality and display size.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be
       written to support cluster-based execution. Equalizer
       furnishes and uses the Collage network library, a
       cross-platform C++ library for building heterogenous,
       distributed applications.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments:
       Equalizer supports both active and passive stereo
       rendering, as well as head tracking and head-mounted
       displays used in immersive Virtual Reality
       installations.

3. About

   Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit, designed to run on
   any modern operating system, including all Unix variants
   and the Windows operating system. A compatibility matrix
   can be found on the Equalizer website.

   Equalizer requires at least OpenGL 1.1, but uses newer
   OpenGL features when available. Version 1.0.1 has been
   tested on:

  3.1. Operating System Support

   Equalizer uses CMake to create a platform-specific build
   environment. The following platforms and build environments
   are tested:

     * Linux: Ubuntu 11.04, 10.10 (Makefile, i386, x64)
     * Windows: XP and 7 (Visual Studio 2008, i386, x64)
     * Mac OS X: 10.5, 10.6 (Makefile, XCode, i386, x64)

  3.2. Window System Support

     * X11: Full support for all documented features.
     * WGL: Full support for all documented features.
     * AGL: Full support for all documented features.

  3.3. Documentation

   The Programming and User Guide is available as a hard-copy
   and online. API documentation can be found on the Equalizer
   website.

   As with any open source project, the available source code,
   in particular the shipped examples provide a reference for
   developing or porting applications. The Developer
   Documentation on the website provides further design
   documents for specific features. XCode users can download a
   Documentation Set.

  3.4. Support

   Technical questions can be posted to the Developer Mailing
   List, or directly to info@equalizergraphics.com.

   Commercial support, custom software development and porting
   services are available from Eyescale. Please contact
   info@eyescale.ch for further information.
