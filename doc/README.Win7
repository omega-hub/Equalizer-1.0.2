GPU affinity for NVidia Quadro cards needs at least driver release 265
on Windows 7.

Disable Aero if you plan on using fullscreen windows.


                 Multi-Node Configurations on Windows 7

PsExec has been used to automatically launch render client
processes. The following steps have to be taken:

- use a user which has administrator rights to connect to the nodes
- turn off User Account Control (UAC)
- disable the Windows Firewall

Otherwise, an access denied error can occur.

Launching an Equalizer application, including all render clients, can be
achieved by using a batch which does the following:

for each client node:
  start psexec \\NODEx -u NODEx\RemoteAdminUser -p password -i 1 C:\Data\EQApp.exe -- --eq-client --eq-listen :<port>

for the eqServer:
  start psexec \\SERVERNODE -u SERVERNODE\RemoteAdminUser -p password -i 1 C:\Data\eqServer.exe C:\Data\configs\Cave.eqc

for the application:
  start psexec \\APPNODE -u APPNODE\RemoteAdminUser -p password -i 1 C:\Data\EQApp.exe

The Equalizer configuration file needs to use the correct IP addresses
and port numbers. Take care that all clients are started before the
eqServer gets started.
