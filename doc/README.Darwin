 Equalizer is developed on the new OS X versions, please refer to the
 latest release notes for specifics.. Other versions will likely work,
 but are not tested heavily. OS X 10.4 or earlier are no longer
 supported. The minimum gcc version is 4.2, version 4.0.1 is no longer
 supported.

Prerequisites:

 X11SDK: Equalizer uses X11. The X11SDK packages is shipped with Mac OS X,
   but not installed by default.

 boost (optional): RSP, the protocol used for multicast data
   distribution, requires boost::asio. The preferred way is to install
   MaxPorts[1] and to 'sudo port install boost +universal+debug'.


Universal Binary Notes

 AGL/Carbon does not support 64 bit. When compiling for AGL, the 64 bit
 targets are disabled. X11 supports 32 and 64 bit binary formats. When
 using GLX alone all these targets are enabled by default.

 CMake configures:
 - if EQ_PREFER_AGL is true:
   - AGL 32 bit on 10.6
   - AGL and GLX 32 bit on 10.5
 - GLX 32 and 64 bit if EQ_PREFER_AGL is false

 At least x86_64 support is buggy in 10.5.0. Resizing a window causes a
 crash. Installing the latest X11.app from
 <http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz> solves this issue
 (the version tested was 2.3.2.1).
