 The Cygwin build is not yet stable. It has only be tested on Windows
 XP. The executables are not yet copied to the same folder as the
 DLL's. This has to be done manually in order to run the examples.

 Please report problems to the eq-dev@equalizergraphics.com mailing
 list.

Prerequisites

 Bison, flex, g++ from Cygwin distribution.
