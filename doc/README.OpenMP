                       OpenMP usage in Equalizer

 OpenMP is used in Equalizer for:

 1) Image compression during network transfer (8-45% speedup on two cores)
 2) CPU-based compositing operations (10-75% speedup on two cores)

 OpenMP is enabled when using Visual Studio or icc on Mac OS X, in which
 case EQ_USE_OPENMP is defined.

 GCC <= 4.3 does not support using OpenMP concurrently from multiple
 threads (http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36242).
 Configurations using multiple pipes per node will not work when OpenMP
 is used with gcc <= 4.3.
