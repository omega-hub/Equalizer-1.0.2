                    Equalizer Hello, World! Example

Overview

  The eqHello example shows a minimal Equalizer application which
  renders some data. The source code should be pretty much self-
  explaining, otherwise the Programming Guide provides more background.

  It illustrates the basic principle of an Equalizer application: The
  application developer implements Channel::frameDraw, which is similar
  to the GlutDisplayFunc for GLUT applications.
