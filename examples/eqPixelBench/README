               Readme for Pixel Operation Benchmark Tool


  This directory contains a tool to measure the performance of pixel
  operations. It is an Equalizer application, which renders one frame
  and uses user events to send the results to the application, where
  they are printed.

  In addition to measuring the read pixels and draw pixels performance,
  it does illustrate the creation and usage of application-specific
  events.
