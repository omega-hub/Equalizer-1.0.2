   OSGScaleViewer, an example combining OpenSceneGraph and Equalizer

OSGScaleViewer was initially developed by students of the Computer
Graphics and Multimedia Systems Group, University of Siegen, Germany and
is now maintained by the Equalizer core team. It is loosely based on the
eqPly example.

CMake can be used as the build system, see the COMPILING file.

When running osgScaleViewer, you can pass a model file and Equalizer
configuration file as parameters:
 osgScaleViewer --model /home/tmg/cow.osg --eq-config examples/configs/2-window.wall.lb.eqc

If you don't pass a model or the model can't be loaded, a quad will be
rendered instead.

Example data can be found at:
 http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/browser/OpenSceneGraph-Data.

This example has camera controls similar to a first person shooter. You
can use the following arrow and pages keys to change the camera
position.  Additionally, you can change the camera viewing direction by
clicking in the window and then moving the mouse cursor while holding
the left mouse button down.

Have a lot of fun!
