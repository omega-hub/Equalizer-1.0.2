This example now uses the Equalizer make environment. It should get
compiled together with Equalizer when using 'make'. The text below is
for using CMake to build osgScaleViewer, e.g., on Windows.


This project uses CMake, you'll need CMake version 2.6 or later.
A quick guide can be found at http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html.

The basic steps to get osgScaleViewer to compile are:

1. Change into the osgScaleViewer source dir
    cd examples/osgScaleViewer
2. Create a build directory:
    mkdir build
3. Change into the build directory:
    cd build
4. If you have installed Equalizer or OpenSceneGraph in a non-standard prefix,
   you need to tell CMake where that is. The easiest way is to set the
   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable, like this:
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/tmg/OpenSceneGraph:/home/tmg/Equalizer
5. Run CMake on the source directory, it will generate Makefiles for you:
    cmake ..
6. Run make:
    make
7. Optionally install osgScaleViewer
    make install
